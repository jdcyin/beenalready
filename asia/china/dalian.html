      <p>‍</p>
      <p>The flight into Dalian transits at Qingdao, which was one of the main German colonies in China. There were a few delays on our red eye flight so we were knocked out for the entirety of the trip. I woke up as the announcement in preparation for landing came on. "Ladies and Gentlemen, we are now beginning our descent." I don't know why, but whenever they say this for some reason I think the plane will land in the next 5 minutes. It ends up always talking about 30 to touch down, but I remain awake for the rest of the descent, having slept of some of the tiredness on the flight.</p>
      <p>I want to start a photo series. On each page will be a showcase of a small picture or two, with a small blurb of text beneath it. The picture will be scenery shots from 'landing' into different cities' airports, and the text will be a small, probably over-romanticized version of what the landing scenery looked like, how it made me felt, etc. There have been a few places that have captured my attention. Back when I visited Oslo, I remember seeing tall evergreen trees covering the land with a few pockets of fjords in between. I could almost breathe in that fresh alpine air despite being in the airplane. When Thorin and I went to Dubai, I was mesmerized by the small, sleepy desert town and their overtly beige scheme for building exteriors. The windows, the doors, all perfectly carved into the mud and concrete buildings. Qingdao was no exception.</p>
      <p>I used to have placemats at home that depicted Chinese-style mountains, in their characteristically jagged and steep, sharp formations surrounded by a thin film of clouds. There was always some person in some traditional Chinese wear at the base of the mountain, in their long robe, sitting in a boat or by the stream. The whole piece was drawn in dark, earthy tones with the border in a deep olive color. As the announcement comes on for the descent, I take a look out to the city. The whole place is covered by a thick fog that envelops the city. As we get closer to the ground, the developments come into sight, as if sticking their necks out above the clouds as if to respirate fresh air. Off in the horizon, I see that classic image of the Chinese mountain. It's barely visible due to the cloud cover but I can just make out the jagged shape of the mountain ridge, with a fuzzy, fluorescent orb hovering above it - the sun, hiding behind the dense clouds. I keep staring out the window at this wonderful sight, a city tucked away at the foot of the mountain surrounded by the winter climate slowly encroaching it. Although as we get closer the building colors become visible, all on the way down the city appears in grayscale, as if seeming to be covered by snow. It is only as we are about to land when the color scheme comes into sight. Still, it's washed out from the cloud cover and the fresh mountain air that blows the clouds in.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>We are only in Qingdao to transit, and the way it's done is in the most Chinese way possible. After immigration, since it's our point of entry into the country, a lady stands at the bottom of the escalator with a microphone telling us to wait (since the flight was delayed). And then, together we go through to checkin for our connecting flight. It's a hoard of people moving through the "nothing good to declare" section of customs, all of us putting our baggage one by one throgh the inspection. Chinese security at an airport makes the American one look like a walk in the park. There are scans everywhere and checkpoints at various points. The group of us transiting to the final point of Dalian look like we're some tour group through the airport confused about where to go. But, we eventually make it onto the same airpline at a flight that is 2/3s lighter than our trip into Qingdao. The flight attendants all look more at ease, and the passengers sitting all have plenty of room to stretch their legs out and lie down on the chairs for the 45 minute flight to Dalian. The flight attendant lets me change seats so I can get a clearer image of the mountains and sea as we fly in, but, knowing my luck I choose the wrong side.</p>
      <p>Landing into Dalian is notably different than that of Qingdao. It was not hidden by a the thin layer of fog, rather, the sun had already shone slightly through by the time we arrived. The fog was lingering but there was a nice, light blue sky along the way. There were a lot of coal plants producing thick clouds of white smoke added some coverage to the sky. Moreso, Dalian is built on a small inlet, and so it felt like going into the 'mouth' of the inlet. On the other side there were more mountains to look at, but on my end it was all housing developments and factories. There seemed to be little farmland (understandable, since the weather is hardly fit for farming this time of year). In fact, there were so many housing developments stretched out along the way that the scenery looked like a housing development model scale from my aerial vantage point. Not only that, it was the style in which they were built. Many high rises all stacked perfectly orderly with their perfectly square and indistinguishable rooms. It was like someone painted a bunch of concrete slabs a dark orange and put it up for rent as apartments. Not only was it interesting in the sense that there were so many high rises (like in Singapore), but it was interesting also in the expansiveness of it (like in America). In one of the world's most populous countries, I guess you would expect to see a bunch of houses that were undistinguished and built for a solid&nbsp;<em>purpose</em>, not aesthetic. I could compalin about that, about how Chinese design is lacking in quality and finesse, but a complaint doesn't house people.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>So, when landing, this was the scene. It started from overlooking the ocean with some industrial or fishing boats floating, and some small waves breaking in the ocean, to seeing the smoking coal chimneys, to seeing the landed housing as the plane landed. Even though the housing was so dense and built in an urban space, you could just see the "Chinese version of suburban living." Miles of similar units without any special appearance, built just for the sole purpose of living and surviving these harsh winters.</p>
      <p>When we got off, we asked the security guard for the directions to the nearest metro stop near our hostel. My first interaction with an authentic Dong Bei person. The impression? Very generous and very kind, directed me with a certain amount of patience and detailed explanation, and then we were on our way. Getting out of the metro stop, the coldness bit. I was in a tshirt, exercise long-sleeve, and then a polo sweater with some jeans. Thorin was wearing something quite similar. The cold instantly blew past the three layers and hit me right in the chest, making it very, very cold. I hadn't felt that kind of bitter cold since Lake Tahoe, that kind of dry bitter cold that is just ambient. Luckily, it hadn't snowed at all so it was just dry ground, and we could take our time to find the hostel.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The hostel is built into the corner of some random housing section and is all concrete on the inside, save for a few windows or pieces of glass that are sprinkled throughout. In a place like Dalian, where the winter is extremely cold, the floors are all heated, and so as I type this my feet are in their socks firmly planted on the ground, having the heat rise up slowly to warm my blood. The place is very modern, with the interior almost resembling a Manhattan apartment that was done all in concrete. There are small benches and tables laid throughout and a cafe tucked into the back that is kind of hipstery and sells overpriced coffee (the true mark of a hipster joint).</p>
      <p>There are guards everywhere here, and they often will stand guard outside of hotels and other public places, just walking around. Their outfits are of a communist-ish inspiration, always militaristic, whether in a dark black trench coat or a dark green uniform. In the cold weather, they will also wear very thick hats that cover the ears, almost resembling the Russian hats that you see in wintertime. Oftentimes, they are located at various places and you can visibly see their presence on the streets, unlike in Singapore where the police presence is very minimal, if nonexistent. Commonly, too you will see them on the metro platform waiting for the doors to open and close. And, of course, before you go into the metro here you always have to scan your bags just for security measure.</p>
      <p>I had one thing I had to get done while here, and that was to open a Chinese bank account. I find that as a general pattern in China, there are some things that are incredibly easy to do without any bureaucracy, and then there are things that are very difficult to do, with many road blocks along the way. Opening a bank account belongs to the former category. All you have to do is walk in with a passport, and then you can have an accout opened. You don't need a long-term foreign pass or work pass in order to do so, making it very convenient. Almost too convenient. For a country that has patrol for many parts of the city, you would expect there to be more stringent requirements for dealing with the legal institution, but nevermind, all I know is that it was convenient. I walk into the ICBC bank near our hostel, and then fill out the form. For the address, I just use my hostel address. Everything is going well until my cell phone number, which I tell them I don't have one since I only have an international number. The look on their faces, if it weren't so annoying at the time (read further), was absolutely pricess. They stared at me blankly and said, "Um.. ok, let me try this hold on." And so what they did was try pushing the account through by putting my international number. However, the system only recognized Chinese numbers with that specific digit length, and since my U.S. number did not match, then it was impossible to open an account. My heart sunk a bit, since we had to wait about one hour in order to get to the front of the counter. I'm getting more in touch slowly with how Chinese countries work, that if you're willing to all in line with the bureaucracy, things can be very easy for you. In fact, things can almost be a little bit too easy for you, such as is with opening the bank account. However, if you fall out of line for one step of that simplicity then it quickly becomes very complicated. I don't end up opening my account that day, and, I end up passing over a lump sum to the bank to deposit. I leave without getting the money back, without realizing until I go back to the hostel. So, I go in with the intention of opening a bank account, and leave with both that initial intention and also gain one to get a local SIM card.</p>
      <p>As we walk around, we pass by large buildings and a very modern city. Chinese cities are all vast, with wide-lanes on both sides for cars to drive comfortably in, and to accommodate for the amount of cars that are newly on the road. For pedestrians, a lot of the roads aren't properly pedestrainzed and so you will often find yourself sharing some space with buses, cars, and strangely enough, e-bikes. It's not that I don't mind sharing with them, but they often silently ride by and so you don't know when they are crossing your path unless they honk. For a bike that travels so smoothly and quietly, it's a definite contrast to their silence. Alongside the newly built roads are also small shops that line the main street, tucked into some concrete building to withstand the bitter winter.</p>
      <p>We have lunch in one of these places, and it's just a simple stall that sells the classics: oil sticks, porridge, cold noodles, beef noodle soup, etc. There is an automatic recording that keeps playing back listing all the generla menu items in Chinese that seems to drown out slowly into the distance the longer you stay there. When we walk in, a man sits up from behind the counter and greets us sleepily and asks for what we want, and we order a beef noodle soup. When he goes to the back to make it, we see that he actually has a bed set up behind the front counter so that he can nap and then greet the guests as they roll in. So, when he propped himself up to greet us he was actually sitting up from his bed, as if we were an alarm clock and just woke him up. He made great soup.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Because Dalian is a modern city, there aren't too many historical sites to see. There are some residual places from the Russians and the Japanese occupation, but otherwise, much of the development had wiped it out, as is the case for much of these modern Chinese cities. Thorin and I were expecting some more street food along the way, but after realizing how cold the place was we quickly understood that most of it wouldn't be outside, but rather, tucked away somewhere else. After walking around to look for it for a while, we couldn't find a food street until we went to a random staircase leading to below the ground floor. We thought it would be an ordinary underpass, but it turned out to be more than that, it was an underground mall.</p>
      <p>The underground mall wasn't as glamorous as the shopping you would see in Singapore, but they were more urban and independent. Each stall is in fact probably owned by the person selling clothes and is not part of a chain. Not to say that they don't have high end malls, but the underground ones are more spaces where young people can hang out, eat with each other, and most importantly, stay warm. And so, these underground malls are in fact the "Bugis Street" of Dalian, that is, the kind of mall where you see more teenagers doing their whole hangout thing. Prior to this, we were in an 'above ground' mall that had a similar layout. But, instead of having more of a mixed clientele, the stores were tucked away and some shops had drapes around the front. I found it a bit annoying that they couldn't openly display all the stuff they had, until I found another sign hanging outside on the window saying, "Please, no men allowed." So, apparently it was a women's only store and because there would often be women changing and trying on clothes, the reason the stores were draped away was for safety reasons. But, this underground mall was pretty fun. There was street food at the bototm as well as many clothes and other shops. It was as if someone took a Taiwanese night market and threw it all underground. We decide in order to brave this weather that we have to buy a thicker jacket, so we go bargain hunting for one and finally get one that's a bit kitsch, but functional.</p>
      <p>We keep walking around the city and take it in small 'bursts.' The cold weather is actually quite difficult to get through, and so we end up passing through from place to place, and ducking into places to eat when we get the chance. We make it to Friendship Square and see a large disco ball in the middle of the roundabout, but that's all there really is over there. Surrounding the roundabout are a few small buildings that are built in a kind of Russian style, with sloped rooves and kind of a gingerbreadish brown. It almost looks like a gingerbread house and a little bit more fitting to the weather, so I'm not sure who designed the building or if it was one left behind by the colonials. In one of these buildings is a KFC, though.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>We go into a pharmacy in order to buy some lotion and body wash as we'll be traveling for the next two weeks here and it's good to stay hydrated on the outside. Lord knows Thorin's skin has been flaking up a storm since we've been here. When we walk in, immediately a lady approaches me and asks me what I need. I explain to her that I want to buy a basic lotion and she knows exactly where it is and the different kinds of scents. I say I don't want one that is too fresh smelling and she directs me to the correct lotion. It's a bit daunting since I'm not used to people approaching me and trying to help me find what I'm looking for. If anything, when people so eagerly approach me I'm more suspicious since I think they're trying to make a sale on me and I hate getting ripped off. But, in fact, if I think more about it it's an incredibly efficient way to have a higher customer turnover, since I was in and out of that store in less than 3 minutes with both items that I wanted. I'm not sure if their job is dependent on their sales commission, but that girl worked it and we walked out with what we needed that day. This happened to us in another pharmacy (a more traditional Chinese pharmacy) that we went to, but there, they tried to give me some chrysanthemum tea with antigylycerin in it. Oops. So, the kind of shop that you need to go to matters a bit, too.</p>
      <p>The night wraps up with us going to have hot pot to celebrate Christmas together. After walking around in the city, we almost forget that it is Christmas. Our only reminders are a few light decorations around the city, and a large Christmas tree in front of the high end more 'western' Pavilion mall that is nearby our hostel. So, to warm ourselves up a bit we decide to go for a final meal together and just bring in the end of the year with some good vibes. In the hot pot restaurant, there is an overweight man to our left that is shirtless with a few bottles of beer in front of him. Behind him, another man who is also slightly chubbier with a few bottles of beer. Both are drinking and eating with the (presumable) family members / friends and are having a good time, enjoying themselves and laughing with their present company. Put any Chinese people in front of a few dishes and youll find them generally happy in present company. On our side of the restaurant, there are other 哥們, brothers, or pals, just eating and chatting together. Some tables of just girlfriends are also gathered for the night, chatting and drinking as the wait staff busily try to keep up. The Dalian beers slowly make their rounds to the various tables and slowly get drunk, and the stench of the hot pot odor seeps slowly into the clothes that are tucked under the chair coverings to prevent this process. There's something about cold countries that brings people together to these communal eating spaces, maybe it's a trait of Asians, maybe it's more of a Dong Bei trait, or perhaps it's more a weather thing. Whatever it is, we also join in that night on the fun and toast each other on Christmas day. There was no family around us, and all we had was each other. Our split-pot of spicy and non-spicy soup base had just begin to boil, a sign that the food was ready to be cooked.&nbsp;</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">

      <p>In our hostel that night, a tall guy of about 1.97 meters starts chatting to me. He is the ultimate definition of a big friendly giant. He wears glasses and is slightly overweight, but has a very friendly and soft melody to his voice; one that his stature would belie. Although his voice is soft, it's delivered with a strong Northern Chinese accent, with all the thick "r" sounds and bounciness of tone. In fact, some of the tones are indistinguishable to me sometimes, and some of the local slang that they use is unintelligible to me. He tells me that he's so tall because he plays basketball a lot, and he details his interest in watching the Golden State Warriors and Stephen Curry, and how he wish he had a chance to meet him sometime. I have to follow this statement with my roots in California and how my brother is an avid Golden State Warriors fan, and he perks up a bit at the sound of basketball.</p>
      <p>Although my Chinese isn't that good, and Thorin's is elementary, despite all this, he is still very friendly and tries to speak a few lines of English to Thorin. Thorin converses to him in Chinese and he's impressed; saying that Thorin's Chinese is far better than his English, ironically to Thorin's not understanding him. Also, the man in the bunk next to me begins a conversion. His accent is also quite strong, but it's a little bit lazier at some of the sharper consonant sounds. His 'zi's sound more like a 'zhi's and he also has a few bouncy tones in his accent. When I ask him where he is from he tells me that he is from Shandong Province, and that he has moved over from there to Liaoning to follow his wife, and find work. He also has a very friendly demeanor, probably not too smiley, but comes to chat quite easily. He sits in a calm cross legged possition on his bed and has a softness to his voice despite a thick accent. I look over at the big friendly giant and this cross legged man and realize that the story of modern China is one of immigration, of movement across provinces, yet everyone retains a part of their home culture. This is most distinghuishable by their accent. But, the unifying language is standard Mandarin and we converse quite naturally in that.</p>
      <p>In Singapore and the U.S., they always pride themselves on the diversity of international people that they have. Fair enough, there is plenty of that to go around. But, in a country with cultural roots as strong as China, where international foreigners may not easily assimilate to the local culture, most of the diversity is domestic and provincial. They lady at the hostel front desk, also with a thick accent, was from Inner Mongolia, the neighboring province to Liaoning. The two men in my room were from Liaoning and Shandong. And I was this random Taiwanese-American guy traveling with an English guy. I look forward to the many more different people that China has to offer. Merry Christmas, everyone.</p>
