      <h2>seATTLE, WASHINGTON, U.S.A.</h2>
      <h4>2016-02-11, 14:33</h4>
      <h4>Stay: Kiki's House</h4>
      <p>‍</p>
      <p>After a tough 2012 post-graduating and a start to 2013, we decided to pick our asses up from under our feet and do our first trip. The trip? Seattle. We were going to go see my godsister, Kiki.</p>
      <p>We land in Seattle to a freezing, cold environment. Pulling into the main university strip, we meet up with Kiki, then head to her house. You can feel the crispness of Washington in the air.</p>
      <p>Since this post is a bit of a back-track, there are bits and pieces I remember. Of course, one of the things we do first is walk up and down the university street since that's where we are located nearby. The campus is impressive, lot of trees surrounding the place offers a nice natural side. It feels like you're studying in a forest most of the time, which isn't so bad.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The big sites to see are Pike's Place market along the Pier, which had a couple of open shops and farmers market type stuff. Further along the pier, there is this famous market where you watch people throw fish at each other and catch it. I think that's the whitest thing I've ever heard of, but it's still a laugh, and imagine putting that on your resume. From there, you were able to walk downtown and check out some of the architectural sights. The national library which has this whole red floor (red light district, anyone?) is architecturally unique. Of course, if you continue to walk along the various sounds and inlets of water (this is my way of calling it since I had no idea where we were), there's a lot of seafood, so we stopped over to have some clam chowder.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The Space Needle is also a sight to see: you take an elevator to the top and then, well, you're at the top of a tall building. I recall the line being quite long given it was the main tourist attraction, but once you get to the top it's kind of just like the view of any city. A lot of lights.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Another interesting thing we did was go to a college house party. My godsister was in her junior year then, and by then had made a few friends who were up for partying that night. You guys, probably one of the best house parties I've been to. You walk into the party, and there's artificial fog and bunch of strobe lights, and the DJ was playing remixes of, yes, you guessed it, Nirvana. Except, it was this pseudo mashup of Nirvana with some other band, not sure what. The scene there was fun, and the house itself was situated in a chalet-esque style up in the forest, so they had a nice backyard and whatnot. Ah, the things you remember when you travel.. of all the places, I think that house party was the most memorable.</p>
      <p>Umm, among other things, we also had a chance to visit a few of Seattle's Firsts: Starbucks, and, REI?? I had no idea that REI still existed, then again, I'm not really the outdoorsy type.</p>
